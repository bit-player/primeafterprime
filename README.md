# Prime After Prime

The code provided here accompanies the article ["Prime After Prime"](http://bit-player.org/2016/prime-after-prime) published at bit-player.org on May 31, 2016. This programs explore correlations among the residues modulo _m_ of consecutive prime numbers. These correlations are not my discovery; they were first fully described and analyzed by Robert J. Lemke Oliver and Kannan Soundararajan in March 2016. For the mathematical background, see their arXiv preprint: Unexpected Biases in the Distribution of Consecutive Primes.

The programs are written in the Julia programming language within a Jupyter notebook. The original version was written in Julia version 0.4, which is now very much out of date. In August of 2020, inspired by an inquiry from a high school student, I set about updating the code for use with Julia 1.0 or later.

Both the original and the revised versions are available here, but I recommend the update, which is found in the directory primeafterprime2020.
